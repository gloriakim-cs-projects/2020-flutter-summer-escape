## Inspiration

Summer vacation is the perfect time to travel around the world to inspire our perspective and to take a good rest to restore energy to prepare for the new school year! 
However, COVID-19 
But COVID-19 has made us stay home alone, and it seems we should let our traveling desire cool off for a while...or, maybe it's not!

## What it does

The app will provide the virtual experience from packing bags to 



## How I built it

**1. Design**

- **Adobe XD** 

**2. Functions**

- I created functions using **Flutter** and designed the specific functions as follows:

**2.1. Pack Your Bag with Camera**

- I used [the website to create the machine learning model](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com) to create the model to classify what the object is captured in order to pop up the objects in the screen. Just in case the function does not work for some reason, I also allow users to search for the specific objects.

**2.2. Fly in Airplane**

- I recorded voices just like the flight attendance to give more real feeling of actually riding on the airplane.

**2.3. Enjoy Summer in Destination**

- Users can now enjoy the destination's scenary with AR!
